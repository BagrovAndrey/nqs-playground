### 12-site Kagome lattice with periodic boundary conditions

  * `hamiltonian.txt` Hamiltonian specification;
  * `ground_state.pickle` a tuple `(spins, values)` where `spins` is a
  `numpy.ndarray` of `nqs_playground.core.CompactSpin` and `values` is a
  `numpy.ndarray` of `numpy.float32`.

Ground state energy is around `-21.779500867887393`.
